          <p>
            My name is Ryan Cleary, I have spent my career on the front lines of security. From military service to frontline roles in prisons, licensed close protection, and leading high-profile door teams, I have worked in some of the most demanding and high-risk environments out there.
          </p>
          <p>
            That experience gave me a sharp eye for spotting weaknesses, operational gaps, complacency, and overlooked risks that can leave venues and businesses wide open. It is exactly what pushed me to launch Clear Cut Security Solutions—an independent consultancy that helps business owners like you make sure your security team is actually doing the job you pay for.

    <div class="about-text">
      <p>My name is Ryan Cleary, I have spent my career on the front lines of security. From military service to frontline roles in prisons, licensed close protection, and leading high-profile door teams, I have worked in some of the most demanding and high-risk environments out there.</p>
      <p>That experience gave me a sharp eye for spotting weaknesses, operational gaps, complacency, and overlooked risks that can leave venues and businesses wide open. It is exactly what pushed me to launch Clear Cut Security Solutions, an independent consultancy that helps business owners like you make sure your security team is actually doing the job you pay for.</p>

    <div class="about-text">
      <p>Maeson Rogers-Miles. With a background in the prison service and over six years in the security industry, I bring frontline experience in surveillance, site protection, and incident response.</p>
      <p>Specialising in CCTV operations, I have developed sharp situational awareness and the technical skills to spot and respond to threats fast. My time in the prison service built a solid foundation in high-level security protocols and risk management, experience Iâ€™ve since applied in both public and private sector roles.</p>
      <p>At Clear Cut Security Solutions, I take pride in being professional, reliable, and vigilant. Itâ€™s all part of our mission to deliver safety with integrity, wherever we operate.</p>

    <div class="about-text">
      <p>Connor Hawkins, I bring the hospitality perspective to Clear Cut Security Solutions. With over a decade working in some of the busiest city centre venues, I have seen firsthand the challenges operators face night after night.</p>
      <p>As a former Pubwatch chairman, I understand the constant pressure to balance great service with safety and compliance. I know how quickly things can go wrong when security is not aligned with the needs of the venue.</p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s why I joined ClearCut, what we do keeps people safe, protects businesses, and makes running a venue smoother and more sustainable.</p>

    <h2>Services</h2>

    <h3 class="reveal">Security Risk Assessments</h3>
    <p class="reveal">We look at your business with a critical eye, not to tick a box, but to find what others miss.</p>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>One-off site assessments</li>
      <li>Venue audits for bars, clubs, hotels and more</li>
      <li>Office and warehouse security checks</li>
      <li>Clear & practical, threat and vulnerability reports</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="reveal">Mystery Guest Checks</h3>
    <p class="reveal">We go in undercover and observe exactly how your security is performing from a customerâ€™s point of view.</p>
    <p class="reveal">You get the truth, not a filtered version.</p>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>Door supervisor evaluations</li>
      <li>Static guard patrol reviews</li>
      <li>Mobile response testing</li>
      <li>Behaviour, attitude and compliance feedback</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="reveal">Training and Workshops</h3>
    <p class="reveal">We deliver security awareness training for bar staff, venue managers and frontline teams. The aim is simple: to improve how your team works alongside your security. Better understanding, smoother communication, and less friction at the front door.</p>

      <li>Frontline mindset training</li>
      <li>One-to-one coaching</li>
      <li>Half-day and full-day workshops</li>

    <h3 class="reveal">Support and Oversight Plan</h3>
    <p class="reveal">For clients who want more than a one-off visit, we offer a Support and Oversight Plan. This includes random spot checks and follow-up visits twice a month, with no advance notice to staff.</p>
    <p class="reveal">We assess how your door staff interact with the public, how they present themselves, and whether they uphold your brandâ€™s standards. When security providers know someone might be checking in, they are more likely to send better staff and maintain high standards.</p>

    <h3 class="reveal">Event Security Management</h3>
    <p class="reveal">We provide full-scale event security management, covering both frontline and executive-level coordination. From corporate launches to large-scale festivals, we bring hands-on experience in running security operations with precision.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Our team has delivered full-spectrum security management for high-profile events, including those featuring artists such as Pixie Lott and Tom Zanetti. Weâ€™ve overseen every element, from strategic crowd control planning to real-time ground coordination, as well as VIP escorting and executive protection.</p>

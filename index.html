          <p>
            My name is Ryan Cleary, I have spent my career on the front lines of security. From military service to frontline roles in prisons, licensed close protection, and leading high-profile door teams, I have worked in some of the most demanding and high-risk environments out there.
          </p>
          <p>
            That experience gave me a sharp eye for spotting weaknesses, operational gaps, complacency, and overlooked risks that can leave venues and businesses wide open. It is exactly what pushed me to launch Clear Cut Security Solutions, an independent consultancy that helps business owners like you make sure your security team is actually doing the job you pay for.

    <h2>Services</h2>

    <h3>Security Risk Assessments</h3>
    <p>We look at your business with a critical eye, not to tick a box, but to find what others miss.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-off site assessments</li>
      <li>Venue audits for bars, clubs, hotels and more</li>
      <li>Office and warehouse security checks</li>
      <li>Clear & practical, threat and vulnerability reports</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>Mystery Guest Checks</h3>
    <p>We go in undercover and observe exactly how your security is performing from a customerâ€™s point of view.</p>
    <p>You get the truth, not a filtered version.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Door supervisor evaluations</li>
      <li>Static guard patrol reviews</li>
      <li>Mobile response testing</li>
      <li>Behaviour, attitude and compliance feedback</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>Training and Workshops</h3>
    <p>
      We deliver security awareness training for bar staff, venue managers and frontline teams.
      The aim is simple: to improve how your team works alongside your security. 
      Better understanding, smoother communication, and less friction at the front door.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Frontline mindset training</li>
      <li>One-to-one coaching</li>
      <li>Half-day and full-day workshops</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>Support and Oversight Plan</h3>
    <p>
      For clients who want more than a one-off visit, we offer a Support and Oversight Plan.
      This includes random spot checks and follow-up visits twice a month, with no advance notice to staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      We assess how your door staff interact with the public, how they present themselves,
      and whether they uphold your brandâ€™s standards. When security providers know someone might be checking in,
      they are more likely to send better staff and maintain high standards.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Event Security Management</h3>
    <p>
      We provide full-scale event security management, covering both frontline and executive-level coordination.
      From corporate launches to large-scale festivals, we bring hands-on experience in running security operations with precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team has delivered full-spectrum security management for high-profile events, including those featuring artists such as Pixie Lott and Tom Zanetti. Weâ€™ve overseen every element, from strategic crowd control planning to real-time ground coordination, as well as VIP escorting and executive protection.
